          "content": "Code review findings from PR #6 (SQLite-to-PostgreSQL). Fix before merge.\n\nCRITICAL:\n1. Migration race condition: run_migrations() has no transaction wrapping. Partial failure leaves DB corrupt. Wrap each migration in BEGIN/COMMIT. Note: CREATE EXTENSION cannot run in a transaction — handle migration 1 specially.\n2. Fragile interval in is_score_stale: uses string concat ($2 || ' days'). Replace with make_interval(days => $2) and bind i32 directly.\n\nHIGH:\n3. status::show breaks for Postgres: checks SQLite file existence, prints 'not initialized' when no .db file exists. Need backend-aware status display.\n4. u32::MAX to i32 overflow: migrate command calls get_recent_events(u32::MAX), cast to i32 wraps to -1. Cap at i32::MAX or add get_all_events method.\n5. Migration only copies 2 hardcoded scan_state keys: add get_all_scan_state() to trait or query SQLite directly.\n6. Migration loses event timestamps/IDs: insert_amplification_event sets detected_at=NOW(). All migrated events get same timestamp, breaking pile-on detection. Need raw INSERT preserving original timestamps.\n\nMEDIUM (fix later):\n7. save_embedding UPDATE silently does nothing if no fingerprint row exists\n8. No concurrent migration protection (advisory locks)\n9. CREATE EXTENSION vector needs superuser (document requirement)\n10. Postgres tests dont clean up (consider sqlx::test or transaction rollback)\n11. post_count as i32 could overflow\n12. sqlite feature flag defined but never gated",

      "description": "Detect amplification attacks where users screenshot posts instead of quoting/reposting them. This bypasses Constellation and AT Protocol backlinks entirely.\n\n**Phase 1: Text-based search (searchPosts)**\nUse app.bsky.feed.searchPosts to find posts mentioning the protected user's handle as plain text (not @mentions). Attackers who screenshot posts almost always reference the handle in their commentary. Low-cost, catches the majority of cases. Known example: @aly.codes was screenshotting posts for toxic amplification.\n\n**Phase 2: Image OCR (production-informed)**\nFor high-signal situations learned from production usage, add OCR scanning of attached images to detect:\n- Protected user's handle visible in screenshots\n- Protected user's post text matched in screenshot content\nConsider local ONNX OCR model (tesseract or similar) to stay consistent with the local-first approach. Only activate for situations where Phase 1 misses attacks that are confirmed through other channels.\n\n**Notes:**\n- Phase 2 scope should be shaped by production data — what patterns do screenshot attackers actually follow?\n- OCR is expensive; may want to limit to posts from accounts already flagged or from known hostile amplification chains\n- Deciduous nodes: 100 (goal), 101 (decision)",

Most 'High' accounts have toxicity <0.10 — they're allies.\n\nFix approach: \n1. Change formula so toxicity is the PRIMARY driver and overlap is a multiplier/modifier rather than additive\n2. New formula: score = toxicity_component * (1 + overlap_boost). High overlap with low toxicity = low score. High overlap WITH toxicity = amplified score.\n3. Raise tier thresholds to reflect real-world score distributions\n4. Keep the overlap gate (below threshold = capped) but adjust threshold for embedding scale\n5.

      "description": "Replace notification-based amplification detection with Constellation's public graph API. This enables scanning any public user without their credentials.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Constellation API for detecting quote/repost events on any user's posts\n- protected_users table: list of users we actively monitor (manual add or signup)\n- Per-user topic fingerprints (each protected user has their own)\n- Shared toxicity scores across all protected users (scored once, reused)\n- Threat scores combine shared toxicity with per-user topic overlap\n- Users should not be added to protection until they sign up or are manually added\n\nScaling & accuracy:\n- Tiered scoring depth: broad shallow pass (20 posts), deepen Watch-tier to 100+\n- Background job for new user onboarding (build fingerprint, then sweep network async)\n- Higher concurrency for network-bound work (16-32 vs current 8)\n- Shared toxicity is the biggest scaling win — score once, compute overlap per-user cheaply\n\nFingerprint & score lifecycle:\n- Full fingerprints for protected users and targets, refreshed periodically with new posts only (incremental, not full rebuild)\n- Toxicity scores refresh the same way — add new post scores incrementally\n- CRITICAL: never overwrite scores that a user has already acted on (blocked, muted, reviewed). Historical basis for actions must be preserved. Score history or versioning needed.\n- Consider: action_log table linking user actions to the score snapshot that informed them\n\nSome of this may be v2 (score versioning, incremental refresh) vs v1 (Constellation + multi-user + protected_users table).\n\nSupersedes #19 (configurable protected user).\nSee docs/research-alternative-approaches.md for Constellation discussion.",

Primary scorer: Detoxify unbiased-toxic-roberta via ONNX (recommended) vs alternatives\n   - Returns continuous 0-1 scores across 7 categories (matches existing ToxicityScorer trait)\n   - Identity-bias mitigation (critical for Bryan's topic areas: fat liberation, queer identity, DEI)\n   - Pre-exported ONNX at protectai/unbiased-toxic-roberta-onnx (~125 MB quantized)\n   - Runs on CPU, no API dependency, Apache 2.0\n   - Alternative: MiniLMv2-toxic-jigsaw-onnx (22M params, even smaller, ROC-AUC 0.98)\n\n2. Integration approach: ort crate (pure Rust ONNX Runtime bindings) recommended\n   - Production-proven (SurrealDB, Bloop, Google Magika)\n   - Pair with tokenizers crate for text tokenization\n   - Alternative: rust-bert (adds ~2GB libtorch dep), candle (pure Rust but more manual work)\n\n3. Fallback strategy: OpenAI Moderation API as cloud backup\n   - Free, 13 harm categories, 95% accuracy, easy reqwest integration\n   - Useful when local inference isn't available or for cross-validation\n\n4. Timeline: Replace now vs keep Perspective and swap later\n   - Perspective works until Dec 31, 2026, but has 1 QPS rate limit blocking pipeline scaling\n   - Local ONNX scorer eliminates rate limits entirely\n   - Replacing now unblocks issues #9 (rate limiting) and #10 (pipeline scaling)\n\nRELATED ISSUES:\n- #9 (rate limiting) becomes moot with local scorer\n- #10 (pipeline scaling) partially unblocked by removing API rate limits\n- #11 (research) completed, report at docs/toxicity-alternatives-report.md",
